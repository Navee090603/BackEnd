I'm going to create the employee login page ,if the new employee then need to create new user else direct login and then in that page employee can mark their attendence for daily then he can apply leave in that page if the manager approve then he can take the leave. I need the frontend in the .Net framework using csharp and backend using SQL. In future if changes need to be done it need to be easy in manner. give me the file path creation and the step by step creation. It should be web based application.
