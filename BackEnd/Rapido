Hi Team,

I hope you're doing well.

I’m writing to report a failed metro ticket transaction that occurred while booking via Rapido from Arumbakkam to Chennai International Airport. Although the payment was successfully debited through Google Pay, the ticket wasn’t issued and the amount hasn’t been refunded yet.

Here are the transaction details:

- Date: [Insert date of transaction]
- Number of Passengers: 3
- Total Amount: ₹67
- UPI Transaction ID: 519156936225
- Google Pay Transaction ID: CICAgKjewrrEDA
- Payment recipient: rapido522347.rzp@rxaxis

Requesting you to please look into the issue and initiate the refund at the earliest.

Thank you for your support!

Best regards,  
Naveen
